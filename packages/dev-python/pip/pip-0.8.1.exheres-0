SUMMARY="Alternative Python package installer"
DESCRIPTION="
Pip installs packages. Python packages. An easy_install replacement.

Pip is a replacement for easy_install, and is intended to be an improved
package installer. It integrates with virtualenv, doesn't do partial
installs, can save package state for replaying, can install from non-egg
sources, and can install from version control repositories.
